No Authentication (developers only)
====================================

This is not really an authentication system at all.  It allows developers to log
in to Jazzee as ANY user.  It can not be used in a production environment.

Enable this for user authentication by setting :ref:`configuration-adminAuthenticationClass` to NoAuthentication.
