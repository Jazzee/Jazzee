What is Jazzee?
----------------
Jazzee is an open source, multi-campus collaboration. It is designed to provide the structure for campuses, departments, programs, and individual specialties to define completely custom online graduate applications with minimal developer intervention.

Description
-------------
Using a simple interface individual users can create very rich applications which incorporate campus required and program specific questions into a seamless applicant experience. This allows campuses to deploy custom applications for every type of applicant without needing to engage an army of developers to constantly modify the interface.

Jazzee frees users from the minutia of web design, application security, and database schemas. With a brief introductions and a few clicks of the mouse users are able to create rich online applications which meet the needs of admission committees and registrars alike. Programs spend far more time word smithing the specifics of applicant instructions and debating the merits of GRE scores than they do actually creating an application. This is a very different experience from working with a distracted developer who has no desire to provide 20 iterations of the instructions page for the faculty to review and is concerned with reusing existing templates and not adding significantly to their maintenance load.

Installation
-------------
Jazzee relies on composer for installing it dependencies.  http://getcomposer.org/
